 1.Write a SQL query to create these tables in your database and insert the data into these tables  with the following characteristics:
a)create table employees(
emp_id int NOT NULL,DEFAULT,
first_name char(50),
last_name char(50),
salary int CHECK,
joining_date datetime,
department char(20)
primary key (emp_id));

constraints used:
NOT NULL
DEFAULT
CHECK
PRIMARY KEY
FOREIGN KEY

b)create table variable(
emp_ref_id int references employee(emp_id) NOT NULL,DEFAULT,
variable_date datetime,
variable_amount int
foreign key (emp_ref_id));

create table designation(
emp_ref_id int references employee(emp_id) NOT NULL ,DEFAULT,
emp_title char(20),
affected_from datetime,
foreign key (emp_ref_id));

 Name the four different types of joins? Give examples of each by performing all the joins on the Employees table and Designation Table.
1.inner
eg:
SELECT EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID,DESIGNATION.EMP_TITLE
FROM EMPLOYEE INNER JOIN DESIGNATION ON
EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID=DESIGNATION.EMP_REF_ID;


2.outer
eg:
SELECT EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID,EMPLOYEE.LAST_NAME,
DESIGNATION.EMP_TITLE 
FROM EMPLOYEE OUTER JOIN DESIGNATION ON
EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID=DESIGNATION.EMP_REF_ID;

3.left
eg:
SELECT EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID
FROM EMPLOYEE LEFT JOIN DESIGNATION ON
EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID=DESIGNATION.EMP_REF_ID;

4.right
eg:
SELECT EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID,EMPLOYEE.FIRST_NAME,
DESIGNATION.EMP_TITLE 
FROM EMPLOYEE RIGHT JOIN DESIGNATION ON
EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID=DESIGNATION.EMP_REF_ID;

What is cross join? Write a query to give an example of the same by performing it on the Employees table and Designation table.
The SQL CROSS JOIN produces a result set which is the number of rows in the
 first table multiplied by the number of rows in the second table if no WHERE clause 
is used along with CROSS JOIN.This kind of result is called as Cartesian Product.

Eg:
SELECT * 
FROM EMPLOYEE 
CROSS JOIN DESIGNATION;

What are the clauses used with Select statements and what are the preference orders of it? 

FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
ORDER BY

 preferences are:
SELECT
FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
ORDER BY

 What is the stored procedure?
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again. So if you have an SQL 
query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.


a)SELECT FIRST_NAME,LAST_NAME,DEPARMENT,MAX(VARIABLES_AMOUNT),
MIN(VARIABLES_AMOUNT) FROM EMPLOYEE 
INNER JOIN VARIABLE 
ON EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID=VARIABLE.EMP_REF_ID
